# bbb-streaming

Use this app to live stream your BigBlueButton classes to Youtube or Facebook.

When you want hundreds, or even thousands of users, to join your BigBlueButton classes, you may not be able to use regular BigBlueButton setup, as that is limited to around 100 users per session. Then live streaming to your users is a powerful solution.   

### How it works?

All you need is Docker running on your machine and a media server such as Youtube or Facebook to stream to.

Once you fetch bbb-streaming on your BigBlueButton server, you need to update a few environment variables including access to your BigBlueButton server, ID of the BigBlueButton meeting/class that you want to stream and Youtube or Facebook RTMP url (see below).

After changing environment variables, start the docker container and start your BigBlueButton class. 

You will notice that the live streaming bot joins your BigBlueButto class with the name `Live`. 

On your Youtube or Facebook live streaming page (see below), you would notice your class getting streamed into. 

Share the streaming URL with your users to view the live streaming of your class. 

### What to stream: video, presentation or both
You can live stream in the following ways:
* Only video: set `BBB_HIDE_PRESENTATION` to `true` in `docker-compose.yml`.
* Only presentation: set `BBB_HIDE_PRESENTATION` to `false` in `docker-compose.yml` and don't turn on the video for the presenter. 
* Both video and presentation: set `BBB_HIDE_PRESENTATION` to `false` in `docker-compose.yml`. The presenter's video will appear above the presentation, as in the default BigBlueButton layout.

## Streaming with API-MATE
```sh
# Get API-MATE URL
bbb-conf --secret
# Ensure meetingId and attendeePW is the same in API-MATE and docker-compose.yml
# Restart docker
```
You can use API-MATE to quickly test streaming functionality.

Get API-MATE url as shown above and open it in a Google Chrome browser. Ensure that meetingID and attendee Password in API-MATE is the same as in docker-compose.yml. 

First click on create URL and then join as a moderator. 

You will get into BigBlueButton session as a moderator. 

Go to 'bbb-streaming' directory and start the docker, if it's not already running.

You would notice a new user `Live` has joined your BigBlueButton session.  

## Streaming on Youtube
```sh
# Edit docker-compose.yml to update RTMP url for Youtube
BBB_STREAM_URL=rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/wf28-fttr-0228-uvas-d5hh
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```
Go to [Youtube Studio](https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard_splash?nv=1)
Copy Stream URL and Stream key and combine them, as shown above, to create `BBB_STREAM_URL` in docker-compose.yml.

Restart docker container. 

## Streaming on Facebook
```sh
# Edit docker-compose.yml to update RTMP url for Facebook
BBB_STREAM_URL=rtmps://live-api-s.facebook.com:443/rtmp/3723139434365952?s_bl=1&s_ps=1&s_psm=1&s_sw=0&s_vt=api-s&a=Abzo1Ejb-3Gh_7et
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```
Go to the Facebook page where you want to live stream and click on `Create > Live`. Select `Use Stream Key` as the method that you want to live strem with. Copy `Server URL` and `Stream Key`, joining them together, to form the value of `BBB_STREAM_URL` in docker-compose.xml.

Restart the docker container.

Use API-MATE (see above) to test live streaming on Facebook.

On your Facebook live streaming page, you would notice the video of your BigBlueButton class is being shown. Click on `Go Live` to start live streaming. 

You have several ways to share live streaming url with your users including:
- Show Live Tab on Page: Example - https://www.facebook.com/higheredlab/live/ 
- Live Video URL: Example - https://www.facebook.com/higheredlab/videos/408835117173971/
- Embed Live Video: You can embed live video into any page on your website

Your users can use Facebook chat, shown along side live streaming video, to interact during the live streaming. 

## Known Limitations
* the streamer does not reconnect, if the connection to BigBlueButton gets lost
* when using breakoutrooms, the streamer will show the popup of the invitation and not be able to get back to the conference
